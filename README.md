# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Teh prupose of this review is to use supervised learning models to train and evlaute models to calssify risk for credit card customers. The review will use data frpm LendingClub to run several analysis to ultimately determine whether the models created can be used to predict credit risk. Teh data will first be split into testing and training data and then six models wil be used to perform an analysis. With each model, the blaanced accurcay score, precisoin and recall score of each model will be shown and then used later to recommend a particular model

## Results

### Resampling Techniques

Recommendaiotn of model to use with justification (depends on accuracy and precision I suppose
